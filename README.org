**** Who I am?

I am a *Software Engineer* focused working on projects with a focus on *minimalism* and simplicity.

**** What do I know

I have experience working with *Elixir*, TypeScript, *React*, and web development technologies in general. I do both backend and frontend development. Currently, I'm expanding my mindset by learning Nix.

I am pretending to be a developer for around 14 years.

**** What do I use
I find myself comfortable with *Linux*, specifically my own system configuration, following core principles:

- *Minimalism*: Only essential components are included, reducing attack surface and maintenance overhead. Suckless software is something which fascinates me.

- *Wayland-native*: Built around modern display protocols for better security and performance.

- *Security-focused*: Incorporating paranoid-level security practices by default.

- *Emacs*: I use mostly emacs for most of my stuff.
